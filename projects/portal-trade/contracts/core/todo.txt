ok what I am building is user can choose between normal supply and arbitrage supply they each mint tokenA and tokenB 

what i am trying to do is when user has tokenB whenever yield is updated in tokenB the funds that is tied to tokenB should move to 

Arbitrage wallet the amount that is moved is the amount of the yield 

remember the token that is transfered to Arbitrage Wallet is not tokenB but it is token that is on pool the real token
